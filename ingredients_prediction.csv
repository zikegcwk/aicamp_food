High oleic oil is any oil that is high in monounsaturated fats.  Olive and canola oil are naturally high in monounsaturated fat, but they are also high in polyunsaturated fats which mean they are not very shelf-stable.  In recent years, scientists have developed sunflower (and other) oils that are bred to be high in monounsaturated fats and low in polyunsaturated fats so they can be used in products that need to be shelf-stable. Why do food companies use high oleic oil? In the past, food companies used hydrogenated oils (trans fats) to keep food shelf-stable and preserve flavor.  When companies had to stop using trans fats, they switched to high oleic oils or palm kernel oil to make their food last longer for customers.  These oils are often used in",2

	Calcium Caseinate is a 
	slow digesting protein source, derived from the casein in milk, that provides a steady release of amino acids for optimal muscle recovery and growth.


	Calcium Caseinate is made by changing the pH of milk. In this state, Casein becomes insoluble in water. This allows manufacturers to isolate it from the other proteins in milk. After this separation, manufacturers combine casein with calcium hydroxide at high alkaline levels and dry the protein to end up with Calcium Caseinate.


	It comes in a 
	powder form that can be mixed into water, milk, or added into a protein shake.


	


What are the benefits of Calcium Caseinate?

	Virtually lactose free
	Very high in protein - yet low in fats and carbs
	Slow release properties - ideal for evening use
	Naturally rich in BCAAs, EAAS and Glutamine - great for muscle recovery and growth

Vitamin C: Natural Vs Synthetic
by  Diane Dean



Many of us have been trained to think that natural is always better, and perhaps, generally speaking, this is a good rule of thumb to follow. Generally true, however, is not absolutely true.  This fact becomes abundantly clear when looking at vitamins.  In past posts we’ve compared the synthetic and natural variations of vitamins A and B, and this week we’ll take a look at vitamin C.
Believe it or not, all vitamins, whether they are delivered via a supplement or fortified in food–synthetic or natural– are made in a lab.  A synthetic vitamin is one that has been wholly made in a lab, and among them there are two types – those that are molecularly identical to their natural counterpart, and those that are not.

Maybe the innkeeper prepared too much or the taste was not so palatable but some soup was thrown away, freezing during the night and crumbling afterwards by thawing and draining, leaving a cracked substance of low density.

What is xanthan gum?
Xanthan gum is a powdery, sugar like substance that is used as a thickening or stabilizing additive in foods, toothpastes and medicine. It can be used to treat lower blood sugar and cholesterol in people with diabetes. While it is FDA approved as a food additive, it is created in a laboratory and is a soluble fiber adding no nutritional value to any sort.
It helps ingredients blend together and to stay blended. Think of canned pet food with chunks of carrots throughout.
Why would xanthan gum be in pet food? Xanthan gum is gaining in popularity with pet food manufacturers because it has a low glycemic index and food containing it can be marketed as ‘gluten free’ which is certainly a buzz word in the nutrition business these days. It is used almost exclusively in wet foo",-1

However, the main application of PGPR is in the chocolate industry, where, besides its action as an emulsifier, it also has important properties as a viscosity modifier and thus improves the moulding properties of the molten chocolate. An additional property of PGPR in chocolate is its ability to limit fat bloom. Known chemical methods for preparing this emulsifier involve long reaction times and high operating temperatures, which adversely affect the quality of the final product leading to problems of coloration and odors that could make it inadvisable for the food industry. As an alternative, the enzymatic synthesis of PGPR by the catalytic action of two lipases has been developed. The enzymes act in mild reaction conditions of temperature and pressure, neutral pH, and in a solvent-free system, wh",-1

Although researchers haven't completely connected all the dots between high intake of fructose from sugared soft drinks, juices, and sugar-sweetened foods and the onset of diseases like diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the findings so far offer another reason to limit sugary beverages and foods.",-1

Why do food companies use high oleic oil? In the past, food companies used hydrogenated oils (trans fats) to keep food shelf-stable and preserve flavor.  When companies had to stop using trans fats, they switched to high oleic oils or palm kernel oil to make their food last longer for customers.  These oils are often used in",2

Sometimes it's made with nothing but cacao beans, and sometimes it's made with a mix of cacao beans and added cacao butter (that's the fat portion of the cacao bean). Either version can be sold as 100% dark chocolate because it contains only cacao-based ingredients. Either version is a savory, rather than sweet, food.

But there's a new crop of 100% dark chocolate available, made by quality-driven producers--and it's worth embracing. Sure, it has bitterness, but it also has a suite of other flavors that make for a complex, entertaining eating experience. (Not to mention, ",2

What is Natural Vanilla Flavor?

But it is not that often that one gets the chance to taste the “real stuff”. The flavor made from the beans of the vanilla orchid is expensive. This is why 99% of the time what is found in food comes from synthetic vanillin. The compound, which is also present in natural vanilla, can be prepared from wood pulp but today most of it comes from guaiacol a substance extracted from a petroleum derivative. Recently though a Japanese chemist, Mayu Yamamoto prepared the synthetic flavor from cow dung. The process, which won him the Ig Nobel, the humorous alternative to the real prize, involves extracting the pulp from the poop, and converting it to vanillin. Natural vanilla can cost up to 200 times as much as the synthetic derivative an there is a lot of fake on the market. The easiest way to detect the fraud is using analytical techniques to detect the presence of side products in addition to vanillin. Natural vanilla is a collage of chemicals whereas the synt",0

But vanillin, the chemical responsible for vanilla's taste and flavor, is a far more complicated beast. Chemically identical to real vanilla, artificial vanilla can be made from clove oil, pine bark, coal tar, bran, even cow dung. Until fairly recently, the chemical lignin, derived from wood pulp, was the most common way of synthesizing vanillin. Most artificial vanilla is now derived from guaiacol, a chemical derived from creosote or Guaiacum flowers. The United States Food and Drug Administration has thrown a hint of confusion (and a note of lychee) into the cut-and-dry definitions of ""real"" and ""fake"" vanilla. Any flavor derived from edible sources can be labeled a natural flavor. Therefore, vanillin made from bacterial fermentation of corn or rice bran is a ""natural"" vanilla flavor – just not ""real"" vanilla flavor.

However, the main application of PGPR is in the chocolate industry, where, besides its action as an emulsifier, it also has important properties as a viscosity modifier and thus improves the moulding properties of the molten chocolate. An additional property of PGPR in chocolate is its ability to limit fat bloom. Known chemical methods for preparing this emulsifier involve long reaction times and high operating temperatures, which adversely affect the quality of the final product leading to problems of coloration and odors that could make it inadvisable for the food industry. As an alternative, the enzymatic synthesis of PGPR by the catalytic action of two lipases has been developed. The enzymes act in mild reaction conditions of temperature and pressure, neutral pH, and in a solvent-free system, wh",-1

However, the main application of PGPR is in the chocolate industry, where, besides its action as an emulsifier, it also has important properties as a viscosity modifier and thus improves the moulding properties of the molten chocolate. An additional property of PGPR in chocolate is its ability to limit fat bloom. Known chemical methods for preparing this emulsifier involve long reaction times and high operating temperatures, which adversely affect the quality of the final product leading to problems of coloration and odors that could make it inadvisable for the food industry. As an alternative, the enzymatic synthesis of PGPR by the catalytic action of two lipases has been developed. The enzymes act in mild reaction conditions of temperature and pressure, neutral pH, and in a solvent-free system, wh",-1

But it is not that often that one gets the chance to taste the “real stuff”. The flavor made from the beans of the vanilla orchid is expensive. This is why 99% of the time what is found in food comes from synthetic vanillin. The compound, which is also present in natural vanilla, can be prepared from wood pulp but today most of it comes from guaiacol a substance extracted from a petroleum derivative. Recently though a Japanese chemist, Mayu Yamamoto prepared the synthetic flavor from cow dung. The process, which won him the Ig Nobel, the humorous alternative to the real prize, involves extracting the pulp from the poop, and converting it to vanillin. Natural vanilla can cost up to 200 times as much as the synthetic derivative an there is a lot of fake on the market. The easiest way to detect the fraud is using analytical techniques to detect the presence of side products in addition to vanillin. Natural vanilla is a collage of chemicals whereas the synt",0

The rice grain quality attributes of different samples are reported in order to evaluate their attitude to malting and brewing and also considering their enzymatic activity. Then, the different brewing processes to produce all-rice malt beers will be described and the final gluten-free rice beers is evaluated and compared to a barley malt beer.

Short time (5 s) ultrasound treatment (24 kHz, 300 W/cm2, 17.5 J/mL) of milk fat induced crystallization onset at higher temperatures and a longer temperature interval between the crystallization of the high and low melting fractions. The solid fat content in ultrasonicated milk fat was higher during cooling to 5 °C and for the first 20 min of incubation at this temperature. After 20 min, the increase diminished, and during further storage, the solid fat content in the ultrasonicated fat remained lower than in the nontreated fat. Ultrasound treatment promoted the formation of spherulite structures and a high degree of size uniformity. Nano- and microscopic changes lead to altered macroscopic properties, where a softer and less brittle milk fat material was obtained, and the effects were sustained during storage.
